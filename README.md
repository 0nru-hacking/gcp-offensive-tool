This repository contains a modular tool developed as part of a Master's Thesis in Cybersecurity. It enables the creation and exploitation of vulnerable configurations in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), simulating realistic post-compromise scenarios such as privilege escalation, identity abuse, and persistence.

---

## üîç Purpose

The tool simulates realistic offensive security scenarios in GCP by:
- Creating vulnerable environments (e.g., overprivileged service accounts)
- Deploying offensive tasks and delayed executions
- Generating impersonation tokens (OIDC) for identity abuse
- Invoking private endpoints with replayed tokens
- Testing persistence and privilege escalation chains

---

## üìÅ Structure

The tool is organized into modular components:

- **`core/`**  
  Contains reusable utility functions such as OIDC token generation and authentication helpers.

- **`modules/`**  
  Reserved for offensive modules (Cloud Tasks and Firestore abuse, Spanner persistence). Currently under development.

- **`cloudrun_api/`**  
  Includes a simple Dockerized Cloud Run backend to receive replayed tokens (for exploitation demonstration).

- **`run_attack.py`**  
  Master entrypoint. Coordinates abuse modules and simulates complete attack chains.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  List of Python dependencies.

- **`README.md`**, **`LICENSE`**, **`.gitignore`**  
  Project documentation and licensing information.

## üöÄ Example Usage

### 1. Deploy a vulnerable Cloud Task with OIDC impersonation

```bash
python3 abuse_cloud_tasks_token_privesc/create_vuln_env.py
```

2. Extract and display OIDC token for the overprivileged service account

```bash
python3 abuse_cloud_tasks_token_prives/exploit_token.py
```

3. Use the token to invoke a private Cloud Run endpoint

```bash
python3 abuse_cloud_tasks_token_privesc/trigger_run.py
```

4. Clean up all created resources

```bash
python3 abuse_cloud_tasks_token_privesc/cleanup.py
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+

- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) installed and authenticated

- GCP project with Cloud Tasks and Cloud Run APIs enabled

---

## Instalation

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onru-hacking/gcp-offensive-tool.git
cd gcp-offensive-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üé• Demo

Coming soon! A short video will demonstrate a full abuse chain using Cloud Tasks, OIDC impersonation, and private Cloud Run endpoint invocation.

üß† Thesis Context

This tool is part of a research thesis focused on offensive cloud security in Google Cloud Platform. It automates complex abuse chains typically executed manually, and facilitates:

    Controlled security research

    Defensive validation and alerting tests

    Enumeration of misconfigured privileges and identities
